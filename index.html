      	<h3>Model: </h3>
      	 A machine learning model can be a mathematical representation of a real-world process. To generate a machine learning model you will need to provide training data to a machine learning algorithm to learn from.
      </p>

      	<h3>Universal Workflow for Adressing Machine Learning Problems</h3>

        <h4>1. Define Appropiately the Problem</h4>
        The first, and one of the most critical things to do, is to find out what are the inputs and the expected outputs. The following questions must be answered:
        <ul>
			<li>What is the main objective? What are we trying to predict?</li>
			<li>What are the target features?</li>
			<li>What is the input data? Is it available?</li>
			<li>What kind of problem are we facing? Binary classification? Clustering?</li>
			<li>What is the expected improvement?</li>
			<li>What is the current status of the target feature?</li>
			<li>How is going to be measured the target feature?</li>
		</ul>
		Not every problem can be solved, until we have a working model we just can make certain hypothesis:

		<ul>
			<li>Our outputs can be predicted given the inputs.</li>
			<li>Our available data is sufficient informative to learn the relationship between the inputs and the outputs</li>
		</ul>

		It is crucial to keep in mind that machine learning can only be used to memorize patterns that are present in the training data, so we can only recognize what we have seen before. When using Machine Learning we are making the assumption that the future will behave like the past, and this isn’t always true.

		<h3>2. Collect Data</h3>

		This is the first real step towards the real development of a machine learning model, collecting data. This is a critical step that will cascade in how good the model will be, the more and better data that we get, the better our model will perform.

		<h3>3. Choose a Measure of Success:</h3>

		Peter Drucker, Harvard teacher and author of The Effective Executive and Managing Oneself, had a famous saying:
		
			“If you can’t measure it you can’t improve it”.
		
		If you want to control something it should be observable, and in order to achieve sucess, it is essential to define what is considered success: Maybe precision? accuracy? Customer-retention rate?

		This measure should be directly aligned with the higher level goals of the bussines at hand. And it is also directly related with the kind of problem we are facing:

		<ul>
		<li>Regression problems use certain evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE).</li>
		<li>Classification problems use evaluation metrics as precision, accuracy and recall.</li>
		</ul>
